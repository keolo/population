# Client

Client is a service written in Ruby that demonstrates
consumption of the server API.

It can be invoked via:

`ruby main.rb 90065`

[Mixpanel::Client](https://github.com/keolo/mixpanel_client) is an even more
robust example of an API client that I've written in Ruby.

## Local Development

* Ensure [Server](../server/README.md) is running
* `ruby main.rb 90065`
